# Prosper Loan Data Exploration
## by Anthony Mulweye


## Dataset

The dataset consists of information 114,000 rows of loan data, and 81 variables including Loan amount, Borrower Income( Stated Monthly Income), Debt-Income-Ratio, Loan Term, Prosper Score and many others. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/prosperLoanData.csv&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1581581520570000), with feature documentation available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gDyi_L4UvIrLTEC6Wri5nbaMmkGmLQBk-Yx3z0XDEtI/edit#gid=0).


## Summary of Findings

In the exploration process, I found that there was a Positive Correlation between Loan Amount and Borrower's Monthly Income. I discovered that with borrowers with a relatively low Monthly Income, the probabilities of getting a Low or High Loan Amount is slightly similar. However, with a High Monthly Income, the Loan Amount received is Higher.

A strong relationship exists between the Monthly Payments and the Loan amount with modifying effect from the Loan Term. On plotting a multivariate plot, with a third variable Loan Term, the Visualization shows that Borrowers with longer Loan Term (36 or 60 months) receives larger Loan amounts.

There was also an interesting relationship between Loan Amount and the Categorical features. More Loans are associated with Borrowers with a Longer loan Term, Low risk involved (high Prosper Score), Owning a Home and being successfully employed.


## Key Insights for Presentation

I focus on the influence of the borrowers income that is; Stated Monthly Income, Monthly Loan Payment, Loan term, Debt to Income ratio on Loan Amount. I start by introducing the Loan Amount variable, followed by the distributions of the other variables, then I plot scatter plots showing correlations.

Scatter plots showing the correlation between Loan Amount and Predictor variable, Stated Monthly income was plotted. The plot showed that When a borrower has relatively low Monthly Income (<8,000 dollars) the probabilities of getting low and high Loan Amount are similar. However, when the borrowerâ€™s Monthly Income is high (>8,000 dollars), he/she is more likely to get a Large Loan Amount.

I further created multivariate scatter and point plots, to show that Loan Term plays a part in determining the amount of loan to be given out. It is also influenced by the Prosper score (risk score).That is, The Longer the Loan Term, and the better the risk score(Prosper Score), the larger the Loan Amount to be given out. This could be because Lenders are more open to giving out loans to borrowers who they don't assess as risks(for defaulting), and providing a long term to pay back the large Loan amount as an assurance.
